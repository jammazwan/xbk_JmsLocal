### JmsLocal NOTES:

Stolen code credits: The activemq.xml file was lifted directly from camelinaction1's public github codebase.

June 30 2016 this was a major pain in the ass to get all the right versions of jars working together. If you come across this later, when revising the versions, and you start getting errors, look at the incompatible versions of activemq and camel first, for problems.

### To Run 

Run the XbkTest.

### WTH? This project has almost no code!

Yup. That's the deal with local JMS. Pretty dumb stuff, once the pom and config code is set up. 

The remote JMS code isn't any different, in that regard.
